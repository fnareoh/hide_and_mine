PREREQUISITES
--------------
1. igraph library
This freely available library (https://igraph.org/c/) is used in our program for graph manipulation (in PFS-ALGO). 
It needs to be installed and configured in:
(i) makefile
the line:
-I/home/k1635844/igraph/include/igraph -L/home/k1635844/igraph/lib
should be replaced with the path where igraph is installed in your system. 
(ii)main.cpp and shorten_Z.cpp
the line:
#include "/home/k1635844/igraph/include/igraph/igraph.h"
should be replaced with the path where igraph is installed in your system.

COMPILATION AND EXAMPLE
------------------------
The implementation of our apporach as well as the baseline that is used in experiments 
compiles and runs on a small example with ./compile.txt

As you can see in the makefile, our approach and the baseline compile with g++ -std=c++11 -O3 
We used g++ version (6.2.0) and it was tested on the following operating systems (MacOS Mojave 10.14.2, Scientific Linux 6.6)

INFORMATION ABOUT THE INPUT AND OUTPUT
---------------------------------------
Our approach 

  Input parameters (we refer to the parameters using the example in ./compile.txt):

    test.txt: This is the input string. It should be a single line.

    sen_pos_test.txt: These are the number and positions of sensitive patterns. The first line is the number of sensitive patterns, and the remaining lines are the 
                  starting positions of the sensitive patterns in the input string.  

    k: This is the parameter k (pattern length). All sensitive patterns must have length k

    tau: This is the parameter tau (see the definitions of tau-ghosts and tau-losts) 

    cost_test.txt: This is the name of a file containing the cost for each item that is given as input to the MCK algorithm.

    weight_test.txt: This is the name of a file containing the weight for each item that is given as input to the MCK algorithm. 

    sen_pattern_test.txt: This is the file containing the sensitive patterns (each sensitive pattern must be in a separate line).

    output_knaapsack_test.txt: This is the output file produced by the MCK algorithm. It is read by main.cpp to produce the final string Z.

  The output is displayed on the screen and includes the sensitive patterns, the input string W, and the output of TFS-ALGO, PFS-ALGO, MCSR-ALGO, respectively.
  For example, one possible output (recall that PFS-ALGO can produce more than one possible string Y) is the following:
  ----------RESULTS---HEURISTIC------------
  Sensitive patterns:
  [aaaa]
  [baaa]
  [bbaa]
  W : aabaaaababbbaab
  X : aabaa#aaababbba#baab
  Y : aaababbba#baabaa
  Z : aaababbbabaabaa

Baseline 

  Input parameters (we refer to the parameters using the example in ./compile.txt):

    test.txt: This is the input string. It should be a single line.

    k: This is the parameter k (pattern length). All sensitive patterns must have length k

    tau: This is the parameter tau (see the definitions of tau-ghosts and tau-losts)

  The output is displayed on the screen and includes the sensitive patterns, the input string W and the output of baseline (referred to as Z). 
  For example, one possible output (recall that the baseline breaks ties arbitrarily) is the following:
  ----------RESULTS---BASELINE------------
  Sensitive patterns:
  [aaaa]
  [baaa]
  [bbaa]
  W : aabaaaababbbaab
  Z : aabaababbbab
